# Quick Start

We are pleased to provide 3D-scene data, associated trained models, and synthesized textures via BaiduNetDisk. 

* Share link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Cy2yV3islAsv9UxLYf94KA?pwd=1234

* Extraction code: 1234

Due to the storage constraints, we are offering only 4 scenes: 'durian', 'wall', 'star_flower', and 'putian_flower'.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/scenes.png" width="100%" height="100%">
</div>

The structure of the provided data is as follows:

    ${DATA_NAME}
        ├── data
        │   └── ${DATA_NAME}
        │       └── images
        │       │    └── ${id}.png
        │       └── transforms.json
        └── logs
            └── ${DATA_NAME}
                └── checkpoints
                └── meshes
                └── field

To get started, follow these steps:

(1) Data Placement: Place the 'data' folder in a location of your choice, ensuring that you set the 'PATH_TO_DATASET' variable in [data_args.py](./data_args.py) to the corresponding path.

(2) Logs Placement: Move the 'logs' folder into the 'NeRF-Texture' directory.

(3) Data Selection: Uncomment the relevant section in [data_args.py](./data_args.py). For instance, if you are starting with 'star_flower', uncomment these lines:

    # DATA_NAME = 'star_flower'
    # surface_type = 'coacd_remesh'
    # coacd_threshold = .8
    # pattern_rate = 1 / 8  # scale factor of sampling patch pixel gap relative to the base mesh's average edge length

(4) Interactive Window: Launch an interactive window by running python main.py:

    python main.py

(5) Texture Viewing and Applying: Click on the 'load synthesis' button to display the synthesized texture. Use the 'load_shape' button to apply the texture to 'target.obj', located in ./logs/${DATA_NAME}/field/.

<div align="center">

</div>

# Prepare Your Data

A dataset is a directory with the following structure:

    ${DATA_NAME}
        ├── ${DATA_NAME}.mp4
        ├── images
        │   └── ${id}.png
        ├── transforms.json

At a high level, a dataset consists of the following:
 * A captured video of the target texture.
 * A collection of images from the video.
 * Camera parameters for each image.

We provide scripts for users to preprocess their own captured data. Please follow the steps below:

## 1. Data capture

(1) Capture a multi-view video of the taret texture and name it as ${DATA_NAME}.

(2) Create a directory named ${DATA_NAME} and move the video to it. The following structure should obtained:

    ${DATA_NAME}
        ├── ${DATA_NAME}.mp4

## 2. Download [MiVOS](https://github.com/hkchengrex/MiVOS)
Download [MiVOS](https://github.com/hkchengrex/MiVOS). In the file [prepare_your_data.py](./tools/prepare_your_data.py), rename the variable 'MIVOS_PATH’ as the path to the MiVOS installation.

## 3. Run script
Before beginning the data preprocessing, it's crucial to assign values to the 'path_to_dataset' and 'dataset_name' variables within the prepare_your_data.py script. These variables define the directory path to your dataset and the dataset name, respectively.

Once these variables are set, you can run the [prepare_your_data.py](./tools/prepare_your_data.py) script to commence data preprocessing. This process includes several steps such as frame extraction, blurred image removal, image segmentation, and camera pose estimation.

    python ./tools/prepare_your_data.py

During the image segmentation phase, you will need to interact with the script by clicking on regions containing textures or objects within the video to effectively segment it.

Upon successful execution of the script, the data will be organized into the necessary directory structure for the next steps of the process.

## 4. Interactive Segmentation

During the execution of the script, an interactive segmentation window will appear. Follow the instructions below to perform the interactive segmentation:

(1) Left-click on the regions you want to segment. This will mark those regions for segmentation.

(2) Right-click on the regions you do not want to keep. This will exclude those regions from segmentation.

(3) Click on the "Propagate" button to propagate the segmentation result to all frames. This ensures consistent segmentation across the entire video.

(4) Click on the "Play" button to check the video segmentation. This will start playing the video with the applied segmentation.

(5) Click on the "Play" button again to stop the video playback.

(6) Click on the "Save" button to save the segmentation results. This will save the segmented frames and associated metadata.

(7) Close the segmentation window when the terminal shows that the results saving is done. The script will continue its execution.

By following these steps, you can interactively segment the video and save the segmentation results for further processing.

# Training

## Coarse shape estimation
After preparing a dataset, you can train a NeRF-Texture based on it. But before that, you need to train an Instant-NGP to estimate the coarse shape by running:

    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main_nerf.py ${PATH_TO_DATASET} --workspace ./logs/${DATA_NAME} -O --bound 1.0 --scale 0.8 --dt_gamma 0 --ff --mode colmap --gui

Please follow these instructions to navigate through the interactive window:

**1. Train**: Upon opening the interactive window, locate the 'start' button to commence the training of Instant-NGP. The process should reach convergence in approximately one minute. Once it does, you can halt the training by clicking on the 'stop' button, which is located in the same area as the 'start' button.

**2. Obtain Raw Base Mesh** : Next, click on the 'save_mesh' button. This action will generate the raw base mesh using the Marching Cubes algorithm on the density field.

**3. Extract Scan Point Cloud** : Proceed to click on the 'save_pcl' button. This will extract the scan point cloud, which will subsequently be utilized to determine the height threshold of the meso-structure texture.

**4. Close the Window**: Finally, upon completion of all the above steps, you can close the interactive window.

</div>

## Train NeRF-Texture

Modify the PATH_TO_DATASET and DATA_NAME defined in [data_args.py](./data_args.py), then run [main.py](./main.py).

    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py

Details pertaining to model training and texture synthesis will be elaborated in the upcoming sections of this content

# Texture synthesis

The summary of texture synthesis steps is illustrated as the following image:

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/nerf-texture.png" width="100%" height="100%">
</div>

## 1. Start training NeRF-Texture

To initiate model training, please click on the 'start' button. Once the training converges, press the 'stop' button, which is located at the same place. It is recommended that the training time falls within the 10 to 20-minute range for optimal results.

## 2. Save checkpoint

Click on the 'save' button to save checkpoints of the trained model.

## 3. Create picked_faces.obj (optional)

The implicit patches are, by default, sampled on the base mesh, which is labeled as 'surface_coacd_remesh.obj' and located in the 'meshes' folder under the logs directory. However, there might be occasions when you wish to sample textures from specific regions instead of the entire base mesh. This could be due to certain areas not being adequately reconstructed, or because the desired textures are found within certain regions.

To customize the regions for texture sampling, you can create a 'picked_faces.obj' file and place it in the 'meshes' folder, the same location where the base mesh is stored.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

(1) Duplicate the base mesh file in the 'meshes' folder and rename the copy as 'picked_faces.obj'.

(2) Next, use mesh edit tools (e.g. MeshLab) to remove the regions that are not needed for texture sampling, keeping only the areas you wish to sample texture patches from.

This way, you can control where textures are sampled from on your mesh.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/picked_faces.png" width="100%" height="100%">
</div>

## 4. Sample implicit patches

To sample implicit patches, click on the 'sample patches' button. This action will store the sampled patches in a '.npz' file within the 'field' folder, located under the logs directory. The progress will be displayed in the terminal. 

Please note that the colors of the rendered patches will also be saved for verification purposes.
If the size of the patches (not the resolution) appears too large or too small, you can adjust the value of the **pattern_rate** parameter. This parameter is defined in the [data_args.py](./data_args.py) file and serves as the scale factor of the pixel gap, relative to the average edge length of the base mesh. Adjusting the pattern_rate accordingly will allow you to achieve the desired patch size.

## 5. Synthesize implicit texture

You will need to assign values to the 'DATA_NAME' and 'MODEL_NAME' variables in the [patch_matching_and_quilting.py](./patch_matching_and_quilting.py), and then proceed to execute the code. By default, the 'MODEL_NAME' is set to 'curved_grid_hash_clus_optcam_SH'. If you are unsure about this, please refer to the 'field' folder located within the log directory for confirmation. The synthesized result will be saved in a **'texture.npz'** file in the 'field' folder under the log directory.

The following image provides a visual illustration of the processes of patch sampling, matching, and quilting. The resulting synthesized implicit texture encapsulates both the meso-scale geometry and the view-dependent appearance, which can be subsequently decoded by a NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) network.

  <img src="./images/texture_synthesis.gif" width="100%" height="100%">
</div>


## 6. Load synthesized implicit textures

Click on the 'load synthesis' button to load the synthesized texture stored in the **'texture.npz'** file. Then the synthesized texture will then be dislpayed within the interactive window.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/synthesized_results.png" width="100%" height="100%">
</div>


## 7. Apply synthesized textures to shapes

To apply the synthesized texture to a shape, first place a 'target.obj' file into the 'field' folder. After that, click on the 'load_shape' button to apply the texture. Please remember that you must first perform the 'load synthesis' operation before proceeding to 'load shape'.

# Notes by Ruihan
* copied data `my_white_lamp_base` from `baymax`, Haven't compiled COLMAP on `deer`
* rsync -avr ruihang@baymax.ri.cmu.edu:/data/ruihan/projects/NeRF-Texture/data /data/ruihan/projects/NeRF-Texture/


## Debug log
* Error when running `main_nerf.py`: "TypeError: an integer is required (got type bytes) open3d" <br>
Solution: 
```
pip install --upgrade pyspark
pip install scikit-learn --upgrade
```
* Packages required for GUI (still didn't solve the problem of ninja_build)
```
sudo apt install mesa-utils
sudo apt install ffmpeg
sudo apt-get -y install ninja-build
```
* try `main_nerf` with `--ff` flag, `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main_nerf.py --path data/my_white_lamp_base/ --workspace ./logs/my_white_lamp_base -O --bound 1.0 --scale 0.8 --dt_gamma 0  --ff --mode colmap --gui` but the program hangs at `from nerf.network_ff import NeRFNetwork` <br>
Temporary solution: replace `--ff` by `--tcnn` flag, it works.

* When try to prepare custom dataset, encounter " Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" even though it is found"
Solution:
```
pip uninstall opencv-python
pip install opencv-python-headless
```
